        <div class="inner-box"><p>Love</p></div>
        <section>Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes.</section>

God loves you! He wants you to live with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today!</section>

        <section>But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.” – Isaiah 40:31
            For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</section>
